It is more applicable in places like speech recognition, spam detection for mails.\n","Also Reinforcement learning is better than Supervised learning because it can also correct the mistakes done during the training process. It is beneficial in applications like chess engines where each output depends on the state of the current input.\n","Unsupervised learning is also useful when the datasets given are easier to manipulate and understand automatically like in E-commerce websites which detect the customer purchases and then gives suggestions based on it.\n","\n","Difference between Machine learning and Deep learning is that the data used is Machine learning is quite structured while that in Deep learing is instead like a neural network.\n","Machine learning consists of thousands of data points while deep learning consists of millions of datapoints. Machine learning is widely used in areas like Spotify, Youtube, etc.\n","while deep learning is majorly used in fields like autonomous vehicles, image recognition, chatbots, etc."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t0cYPf4kt9_L"},"source":["**Write a function to check whether the number is Palindrome or not.**  \n","- Hopefully who have did this in c++ in yor CS101"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"oWBHDgbquM1p"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["121 is a palindrome\n"]}],"source":["n=int(input(\"enter a number: \"))\n","word=str(n)\n","letters=list(word)\n","rletters=letters[::-1]\n","if letters == rletters:\n","    print(n,\"is a palindrome\")\n","else:\n","    print(n,\"is not a palindrome\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bHfCcuG3uAww"},"source":["\n","Create a NumPy array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100 and calculate the mean, minimum, and maximum values\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"pVr18sOTuQy6"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["[51 15  4 90 19  2 17 44 60  2]\n","30.4\n","2\n","90\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import random\n","A = []\n","for i in range(10):\n","    A.append(random.randint(1,100))\n","arr=np.array(A)\n","print(arr)\n","print(arr.mean())\n","print(arr.min())\n","print(arr.max())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IjeenGc8uFYK"},"source":["\n","Create a Pandas DataFrame from a dictionary containing three columns: 'Name', 'Age', and 'City'.
